# Deployment Guide for Vercel

This guide will help you deploy the Restaurant Finder application to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

1. A Vercel account (sign up at https://vercel.com)
2. A Google Maps API key
3. A deployed backend API (Laravel) on a service like Railway, Heroku, or similar

## Step 1: Deploy the Backend (Laravel)

Since Vercel is primarily for frontend applications, you'll need to deploy your Laravel backend separately. Here are some recommended services:

### Option A: Railway
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Create a new project
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Set the root directory to `backend`
5. Add environment variables for your Laravel app

### Option B: Heroku
1. Create a Heroku app
2. Set buildpack to PHP
3. Deploy the `backend` folder
4. Configure environment variables

### Option C: DigitalOcean App Platform
1. Create a new app
2. Connect your repository
3. Set source directory to `backend`
4. Configure environment variables

## Step 2: Prepare for Vercel Deployment

1. **Update the API URL**: Once your backend is deployed, update the API URL in your environment variables.

2. **Set up environment variables**: You'll need to set these in Vercel:
   - `NUXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: Your Google Maps API key
   - `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`: Your deployed backend API URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.railway.app/api`)

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

### Method 1: Using Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. From your project root, run:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. Follow the prompts:
   - Set up and deploy? `Y`
   - Which scope? Select your account
   - Link to existing project? `N`
   - What's your project's name? `restaurant-finder`
   - In which directory is your code located? `./`

5. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   vercel env add NUXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
   vercel env add NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL
   ```

6. Deploy:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Method 2: Using Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your Git repository
4. Configure project settings:
   - Framework Preset: `Nuxt.js`
   - Root Directory: `./` (leave default)
   - Build Command: `cd frontend && npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `frontend/.output/public`
   - Install Command: `cd frontend && npm install`

5. Add environment variables in the "Environment Variables" section:
   - `NUXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: Your Google Maps API key
   - `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`: Your backend API URL

6. Click "Deploy"

## Step 4: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to "Settings" > "Domains"
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS records as instructed by Vercel

## Step 5: Set up Continuous Deployment

Vercel automatically sets up continuous deployment from your Git repository. Every push to your main branch will trigger a new deployment.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build fails**: Check that all dependencies are listed in `frontend/package.json`
2. **Environment variables not working**: Ensure they're prefixed with `NUXT_PUBLIC_` for client-side access
3. **API calls failing**: Verify your backend is deployed and the API URL is correct
4. **Google Maps not loading**: Check your API key and ensure the Maps JavaScript API is enabled

### Debug Commands:

```bash
# Check build locally
cd frontend && npm run build

# Test locally with production build
cd frontend && npm run preview

# Check Vercel logs
vercel logs
```

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Frontend is accessible and loads correctly
- [ ] Google Maps integration works
- [ ] Restaurant search functionality works
- [ ] API calls to backend are successful
- [ ] All environment variables are set correctly

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify backend API is accessible
